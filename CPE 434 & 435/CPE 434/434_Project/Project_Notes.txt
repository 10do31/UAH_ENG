According to a recent study, the global market for smart home technology is projected to reach $158 billion by 2024.
Digital Home Walls represent a small but growing segment of this market, with several companies offering various products and services.
Our project aims to differentiate itself by focusing on affordability, simplicity, and ease of installation.

Slide 4: Technology Overview

Digital Home Walls consist of a modular panel system that can be customized to fit any room size and shape.
The panels are equipped with LED screens, speakers, and sensors that can display images, videos, and information, as well as detect user inputs.
The panels are controlled by a central hub that can be accessed through a mobile app or voice commands.

Slide 5: Design Concepts

Our project team has developed several design concepts that showcase the potential of Digital Home Walls, such as:
A living room wall that displays art, photos, and videos, and also serves as a home theater system.
A kitchen wall that displays recipes, weather updates, and entertainment content, and also serves as a sound system and a voice assistant.
A bedroom wall that displays ambient lighting, relaxation content, and health data, and also serves as a sleep aid and an alarm clock.

Slide 6: Prototype Development

Our project team has built a functional prototype of Digital Home Walls using off-the-shelf components and open-source software.
The prototype features a modular panel system with a

Designing a futuristic interactive home wall with an operating system would require a significant investment in both hardware and software. The estimated cost will depend on the specific features and functionality you want to include, as well as the complexity of the installation process.

Hardware costs will depend on the size and quality of the display screen, the processing power of the computer, and any additional sensors or components required for the interactive features. A large, high-quality display screen alone can cost several thousand dollars, while a high-end computer with the necessary processing power could cost upwards of $2,000.

Software costs will depend on the operating system and any custom software development required to create the desired functionality. If you are using a pre-existing operating system like Windows or MacOS, there may be licensing fees involved. Custom software development could add significantly to the cost, with rates ranging from $75 to $200 per hour or more.

Installation costs will depend on the complexity of the project and any custom construction required to install the interactive wall. If you are simply mounting a display screen on an existing wall, installation costs may be relatively low. However, if you are designing a custom-built wall with integrated sensors and other features, installation costs could be much higher.

Overall, the estimated cost of a futuristic interactive home wall with an operating system could range from $10,000 to $50,000 or more, depending on the specific features and functionality required. However, this is just a rough estimate, and actual costs will depend on a variety of factors.
